  Various extensions provide functionality to rewrite repository history. These
  enable more powerful - and often more productive - workflows.
  
  If history rewriting is enabled, the following extensions will be enabled:
  
  absorb
     `hg absorb` automatically squashes/folds uncommitted changes in the working
     directory into the appropriate previous changeset. Learn more at
     https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2018/11/05/absorbing-commit-changes-in-mercurial-4.8/.
  
  histedit
     `hg histedit` allows interactive editing of previous changesets. It presents
     you a list of changesets and allows you to pick actions to perform on each
     changeset. Actions include reordering changesets, dropping changesets,
     folding multiple changesets together, and editing the commit message for
     a changeset.
  
  rebase
     `hg rebase` allows re-parenting changesets from one "branch" of a DAG
     to another. The command is typically used to "move" changesets based on
     an older changeset to be based on the newest changeset.
