  The evolve extension is a Mercurial extension for faster and
  safer mutable history. It implements the changeset evolution concept
  for Mercurial, allowing for safe and simple history re-writing. It
  includes some new commands such as fold, prune and amend which may
  improve your user experience with Mercurial.
  
  The evolve extension is recommended for working with Firefox repositories.
  More information about changeset evolution can be found by running:
  
    $ hg help evolution
  
  as well as:
  
    $ hg help -e evolve
  
  once the `evolve` extension is enabled.
  
  (Relevant config option: extensions.evolve)
