This repository contains a Mercurial extension (and supplementary libraries)
that override hg commit to run eslint and prettier as a hook.

To activate the extension, place the following in your .hgrc:

  [extensions]
  js-format = /path/to/version-control-tools/hgext/js-format

Once activated, run `hg help js-format` for information about this extension.
